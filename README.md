# A Python-based Python Interpreter

## Introduction

Here are many Python interpreters being used(CPython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython...). Here I select 
PyPy to achieve. The final goal of this project is providing a simple Python interpreter. The features of this interpreter will be introduced in the following part.

## Features

1. It can execute simple arithmetical and logical operations
2. It can run conditional statements and loops

## Stages

1. Building parts of Read, Print separately  
2. Building the frame of Read-Eval-Print Loop(REPL)  
3. Improving the Eval part

## Experiments

To be continued...

## Progress

| Date  |           Progress           |
| :---: | :--------------------------: |
| Feb 6 | Begin building the structure |

## Acknowledgement

The design of this interpreter partly refers to Byterun by Allison Kaptur and Ned Batchelder. From Byterun, I adopted the basic
structure and principles of designing a Python interpreter.
