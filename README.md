# A Python-based Python Interpreter

## Introduction

Here are many Python interpreters being used(CPython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython...). Here I select 
PyPy to achieve. The final goal of this project is providing a simple Python interpreter with interactive interface.

## Stages

1.Building parts of Read, Print separately  
2.Building the frame of Read-Eval-Print Loop(REPL)  
3.Adding the part of Syntax Check  
4.Improving the Eval part

## Experiments

To be continued...
